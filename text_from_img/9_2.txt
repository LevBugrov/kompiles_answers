question 2

1/1 point (graded)

if we have the following program:
class main inherits 10 {
xiint<— 5;
foo(z:int) : int {
x+z
i
bar(y:int) : int {{
let x: int — tin
let z= int <— 2in
footy);
m
main(): object {f
let x: int <7 in
out_int(foo(bar(3}))};
m
}

what would the the program print assuming it is statically scoped?
