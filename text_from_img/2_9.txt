1/1 point (graded)

consider following 4 grammars:
g1.5 > asb | sb|b
62.5 sa| sb|e

g3. + sas | €

g4. s > bt
t at |e

let n = the number of grammars where there exists a string that has at least two different left-most
derivations;

m = the number of grammars where for any string, we only have one parse tree;

k = the number of grammars that can be used with a recursive descent parser

choose the correct value for n,m and k.

o n=tm=2;k=1

n=i;m=1;k=0

n=2;m=2;k=1

n=2;m=2;k=2
