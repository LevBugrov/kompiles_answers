which of the following statements are true?

choose all that apply]

e1 generates more mips instructions than e2.

lv] the code for e2 uses more stack space than the code for £1.

e2 generates 21 mips instructions.

e1 generates fewer mips instructions than e2.

lv] £1 and e2 require the same number of stack pop actions.

ly} e1 generates 19 mips instructions.

v
otbet
bepho:
