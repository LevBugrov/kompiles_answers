question 6

1/1 point (graded)

for the program in question 5, assume the constant propagation algorithm has completed.

which of the following statements is true?

l_n is the statement at line n, and c(l,v,in} = c means that at the "in" of statement l variable v is some
constant, and c(l,v,in) = t means v is not a constant.

choose all that apply]

vy] cil7, w, in) = t

cil2, y, out) = c

vy] cils, x, out} = c

y] cil4, y, in) = t

cil8, z, out) = c
