in the activation tree, how many direct children does the activation of the first call to fib in main have, and what
is the maximum depth of the activation tree? assume a single root node as a tree has a depth of 1.

o children: 2, depth: 5
o children: 4, depth: 5
o children: 3, depth: 6

o children: 2, depth: 4

Â© children: 3, depth: 5
