question 2

1/1 point (graded)

now consider an optimization strategy that picks an order for applying copy propagation, constant folding, and
constant propagation, and repeatedly performs those three optimizations in the same order until nothing
changes.

what is the worst possible order (i.e. requires the most passes) for the basic block given in question 1?
