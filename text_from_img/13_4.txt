question 4

1/1 point (graded)

which of the following statements about dataflow analyses is true?
for these choices, dataflow analysis 1 initializes the variables to t at entry, and to _l at all other points, as
discussed in class, while dataflow analysis 2 initializes the variables to t at all points in the control flow graph.

dataflow analysis 2 always produces a different final set of variable-value pairs than dataflow analysis
1.

lv] assuming dataflow analysis 1 is correct (overapproximates the possible values of variables) and
dataflow analysis 2 terminates, dataflow analysis 2 must be correct.

lv] the order in which a dataflow analysis iterates over the different statements of the code does not
change the final set of variable-value pairs, as long as the analysis repeats this process until there is no
change.

lv] if there is a fixed, finite number of possible annotations each variable can take in our dataflow analysis,
then the dataflow analysis is guaranteed to terminate.
