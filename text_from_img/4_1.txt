acca ye

iy] aba
v
iy] abcbcba
x
explanation

the production y > cxc shows that c's always appear in pairs, which rules out the first answer. the production
x > by shows that every string with c's also has b's (since this production generates a b and must be used to
generate any c's), ruling out the second answer. combining this production with y > cxc, we see that the last
c must appear after the last b, which rules out the fourth answer. we then note that s > axa > abya > aba
derives the third answer.
