question 3

1/1 point (graded)

which of the following are true of the initial state of the slr(1) parsing automaton from the last question
(question 2)? [choose all that apply]

the state has a reduce-reduce conflict on end-of-input.

lv] the state has a reduce-reduce conflict on input ‘('.

the state has a reduce-reduce conflict on input x.

the state has a reduce-reduce conflict on transition s.

this state has a shift-reduce conflict on end-of-input.

this state has a shift-reduce conflict on input ‘(’.

l¥| this state has a shift-reduce conflict on input x.

this state has a shift-reduce conflict on transition s.

“("is in follow(s} and follow(a) at the same time, so the state has a reduce-reduce conflict.

a —- .xis in the initial state, so the state can shift on x, x is in follow(s), the state can reduce, then the state
has a shift-reduce conflict on x.
